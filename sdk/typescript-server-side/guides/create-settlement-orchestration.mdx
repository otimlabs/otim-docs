Settlement orchestrations are created by specifying the final settlement chain and token the recipient will receive for the payment. Here's all it takes:

```typescript
  // Prepare the settlement orchestration
  const settlement = prepareSettlement({
    amount: 10,
    chainId: chains.base.id,
    token: "USDC",
    recipient: recipientAddress,
    note: "Settlement orchestration from Otim SDK example",
    maxRuns: 1, // Optional: limit the number of times this orchestration can be executed
  });

  // Create the settlement orchestration
  const result = await client.orchestration.create(settlement);

  console.log("✓ Settlement orchestration created successfully!\n");
  console.log("Request ID:", result.requestId);
  console.log("Ephemeral Wallet Address:", result.ephemeralWalletAddress);
```

A couple notes:
- You can check the list of available chains by importing `chains` from the SDK.
- `amount` is denominated in dollars
- The only 2 acceptable tokens for `token` are `'USDC'` and `'USDT'`, as settlement is only made available to stables.

Once created, you should receive a `requestId` and `ephemeralWalletAddress`. The `ephemeralWalletAddress` is the payment address that you will send to whoever is paying.

## **Tracking an Orchestration**

Want to get a specific orchestration? Just fetch the details using its `requestId`:
```typescript
  const orchestrationDetails = await client.orchestration.getDetails({
    requestId: result.requestId,
  });
  console.log('Orchestration details results:', JSON.stringify(orchestrationDetails, null, 2));
```

Want to get all of the orchestrations created with details? Fetch with this:
```typescript
 const requests = await client.orchestration.list({
    direction: 'from',
    statuses: ['pending', 'inProgress', 'paid'],
    perPage: 10,
    page: 0
  });
  console.log('All orchestrations:', JSON.stringify(incomingRequests, null, 2));
```
