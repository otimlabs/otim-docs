Otim SDK provides a complete toolkit for integrating Otim’s smart automation capabilities into your app. Built with TypeScript-first design, the SDK offers intuitive APIs for authentication, delegation, instruction building, and activation.

## Key Features

- **SIWE Authentication** – Sign In With Ethereum for Secure EOA Delegation.
- **Instruction Builder** – Type-safe APIs for transfers, swaps, sweeps, and refuels.
- **Configuration Data** – Chain support, token lists, and fee estimation.
- **Universal Module Support** – CommonJS and ES modules for any JavaScript environment.

## Architecture

The Otim ecosystem is composed of clearly defined layers. The SDK represents the **client layer** running inside your application and orchestrates communication with off-chain services and on-chain smart contracts.

- **Client Layer (Your App using Otim SDK)**. Runs in browser, Node.js, or React Native apps. Handles authentication, instruction building, and signing.
- **Off-chain Services (API & Executor).** The API receives the signed instructions from the SDK. A backend **Executor** service then monitors the blockchain for the instruction's specific conditions. When conditions are met, it submits the transaction to the network to be executed.
- **On-chain Protocol (Smart Contracts).** A set of audited smart contracts (`OtimDelegate`, `InstructionStorage`, `ActionManager`) forms the trustless execution layer. They validate the incoming transaction from the Executor, manage the instruction's state, and call the appropriate `Action` contract (e.g., for a transfer or swap) to complete the user's request.
