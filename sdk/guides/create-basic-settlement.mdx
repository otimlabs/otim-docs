This guide shows you how to create a settlement orchestration that accepts tokens across multiple chains and settles to USDC on Base.

<Note>
Make sure you've completed the [Installation & Setup](/sdk/installation-and-setup) before continuing.
</Note>

## Define the Settlement

A settlement orchestration specifies:
- **Settlement token and chain**: What the recipient receives and where
- **Accepted tokens**: Which tokens on which chains can be used as payment
- **Recipient address**: Who receives the final settlement

<CodeGroup dropdown>

```go main.go
const (
	// Chain IDs
	ethereumChainID = 1
	baseChainID     = 8453

	// Token addresses
	usdcEth  = "0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48"
	usdcBase = "0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913"
)

// Settlement amount: 1 USDC (6 decimals)
amount := new(big.Int)
amount.SetString("1000000", 10)

// Build settlement request
buildRequest := &client.BuildSettlementOrchestrationRequest{
	Params: &client.SettlementParams{
		AcceptedTokens: map[client.ChainID][]common.Address{
			ethereumChainID: {common.HexToAddress(usdcEth)},
			baseChainID:     {common.HexToAddress(usdcBase)},
		},
		SettlementChainId: baseChainID,
		SettlementToken:   common.HexToAddress(usdcBase),
		SettlementAmount:  hexutil.Big(*amount),
		RecipientAddress:  common.HexToAddress("<RECIPIENT_ADDRESS>"),
	},
}

// Build, sign, and submit
buildResponse, _ := otimClient.BuildSettlementOrchestration(ctx, buildRequest)
newRequest, _ := otimClient.NewOrchestrationFromBuild(ctx, buildResponse)
otimClient.NewOrchestration(ctx, newRequest)

fmt.Println("Request ID:", buildResponse.RequestID)
fmt.Println("Payment Address:", buildResponse.EphemeralWalletAddress.Hex())
```

```typescript index.ts
// Define settlement
const settlement = prepareSettlement({
  amount: BigInt(1000000), // 1 USDC (6 decimals)
  chainId: chains.base.id,
  token: '0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913', // USDC on Base
  recipient: '<RECIPIENT_ADDRESS>',
  acceptedTokens: {
    [chains.mainnet.id]: ['0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48'], // USDC on Ethereum
    [chains.base.id]: ['0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913'],    // USDC on Base
  },
  maxRuns: 1
});

// Create orchestration
const result = await client.orchestration.create(settlement);

console.log("Request ID:", result.requestId);
console.log("Payment Address:", result.ephemeralWalletAddress);
```

</CodeGroup>

## Understanding the Response

When created successfully, you'll receive:
- **Request ID**: Unique identifier for tracking this orchestration
- **Payment Address**: The ephemeral wallet address to share with whoever is sending payment

The sender transfers their tokens to the payment address, and Otim handles the cross-chain settlement to deliver the specified amount to your recipient.

## Run It

<CodeGroup dropdown>

```go Command Line
go run main.go
```

```typescript Command Line
npx tsx index.ts
```

</CodeGroup>

## Next Steps

- [Track your orchestration](/sdk/guides/track-orchestration) to monitor its status
- Check out the [Otim Playground](https://github.com/otimlabs/otim-playground) for complete working examples
