## Overview

The Otim API makes it easy for developers to integrate Otim into their app and wallet experiences. This is best used by those who want to:
- create an embedded smart action experience for their users, or
- use Otim in a headless, programmatic way for themselves.

## Content types

The Otim API always accepts JSON in request bodies and returns JSON in response bodies. You will need to send the `content-type: application/json` header in requests.

## Authentication

Almost every API endpoint is authenticated using Bearer JWT tokens. To retrieve an account's JWT token, sign an Otim-formatted SIWE (reference for this soonTM) and call the [Log in](/api-reference/auth/login) endpoint with that SIWE and the signature over it.
