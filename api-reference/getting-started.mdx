## Overview

The Otim API makes it easy for developers to integrate Otim into their app and wallet experiences. This is best used by those who want to:
- create an embedded smart action experience for their users, or
- use Otim in a headless, programmatic way for themselves.

## Content types

The Otim API always accepts JSON in request bodies and returns JSON in response bodies. You will need to send the `content-type: application/json` header in requests.

## Authentication

Almost every API endpoint is authenticated using Bearer JWT tokens. To here's how to get the Otim-specific SIWE to sign:

```typescript
import { createSiweMessage } from 'viem/siwe';

const walletAddress = ...;
const chainId = ...;

const siweMessage = createSiweMessage({
    domain: 'otim.com',
    address: walletAddress,
    statement: 'By signing in, you agree to the Terms and Conditions (https://otim.com/tac) and Privacy Policy (https://otim.com/pp).',
    uri: 'https://otim.com',
    version: '1',
    chainId: chainId,
    nonce: Date.now().toString(),
    issuedAt: new Date(),
});

console.log('siwe:', siweMessage);
```

Now that you have your SIWE message, sign it and head over to the [Log in](/api-reference/auth/login) page to enter both the message and signature to get your JWT token!
