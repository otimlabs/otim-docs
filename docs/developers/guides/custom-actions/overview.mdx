We're working hard to implement Action contracts that are useful right out of the box, but we're sure there are a million more ways to use the Otim protocol. This is exactly why we built the `Call` and `MultiCall` Actions.

The `Call` Action simply allows users to call any smart contract with arbitrary data and value. The `MultiCall` Action works exactly the same except it executes a batch of function calls in sequence.

These Actions can be used to call a smart contract at specific time intervals or whenever a certain condition is met on-chain. In the next two sections, we'll run through a simple example for each of these cases.
