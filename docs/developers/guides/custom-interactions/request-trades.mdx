title: Request Trades
---

For this example, let's say you want to create an NFT marketplace app :fireworks: using Otim's Trade feature.

In an Otim Trade, two users make an agreement in which they each execute an Instruction atomically. For example, if Alice and Bob want to swap ERC20 tokens with each other directly without using an exchange, they can simply create a Trade in which:
1. Alice executes a `TransferERC20` Instruction sending X amount of TokenA to Bob
2. Bob executes a `TransferERC20` Instruction sending Y amount of TokenB to Alice

Both of them review this agreement, sign, then both Instructions are executed atomically.

To create your NFT marketplace, you could simply have users log into their Otim-delegated accounts and post any NFTs they would like to sell on your frontend. Users could then browse all of these NFTs and request to purchase them from other users.

If a user wants to buy a particular NFT, say with `USDC`, they can request a Trade with the seller of the NFT. The Trade would be comprised of the following Instructions:

The buyer's Instruction:

- set `Instruction.maxExecutions` to `1`
- set `Instruction.action` to the address of the `TransferERC20` Action
- set `Instruction.arguments` to encoded calldata specifying:
  - the token address of `USDC`
  - the address of the seller
  - the amount they are willing to pay

The seller's Instruction:

- set `Instruction.maxExecutions` to `1`
- set `Instruction.action` to the address of the `TransferERC721` Action
- set `Instruction.arguments` to encoded calldata specifying:
  - the token address of the NFT
  - the address of the buyer
  - the tokenId for the particular NFT instance

The buyer would then sign this Trade and submit it to Otim for processing:

Otim would notify the seller that they received a request then the seller would review the terms of the Trade and sign if they agree. Otim would then use this signature to execute the Trade on-chain:
