Otim Orchestrators are financial agents that turn complex, multi-step stablecoin routing into a single transfer. No more juggling swaps, transfers, or async calls across chains and tokens. Simply send any asset on any chain to an Orchestrator address, and always get the result you expect.

Think of them like **webhooks for money**: they use the Otim OS under the hood to automatically route and transform any incoming asset based on the desired settlement state.

### Why Use Orchestrators?

- **Single API Call**: Define your desired money flow and generate an Orchestrator address via a single API call
- **Automatic Routing**: Send any digital asset to the Orchestrator and watch it route and transform **on autopilot**
- **Flexible Configuration**: Configure Orchestrators for one-time or persistent usage
- **Trustless & Non-Custodial**: Every Orchestrator is **non-custodial** with **trustless execution** and **built-in compliance**

## Use Cases

### Cross-Chain Payment Settlement

Accept payments in any asset on any chain, and automatically:
- Bridge assets across chains
- Convert to your preferred settlement currency
- Route to any financial account

### Yield Vault Deposits

Send any asset to deposit into a yield vault that only accepts USDC. The Orchestrator automatically:
- Accepts multiple asset types (ETH, USDT, DAI, etc.)
- Swaps them to USDC if needed
- Deposits the USDC into the yield vault

### Bank Conversions & Fiat Orchestration

Orchestrate complex fiat settlement flows across multiple local currencies, tokens, and banking partners. The Orchestrator handles:
- Converting any digital asset to fiat across all kinds of local currencies (USD, EUR, etc.) and acceptable token formats
- Accepting assets from any chain and automatically convert them to bank-acceptable formats
- Settling to traditional banking partners
- Orchestrating assets immediately when onramped assets land on an Orchestrator
