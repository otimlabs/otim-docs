Each Action contract must implement the `IAction` interface. This interface defines two external functions: `argumentsHash` and `execute`

### `argumentsHash`

This function returns the information necessary to construct the signing hash for the Instruction depending on the Action arguments.


### `execute`

The `execute` function contains the actual feature-specific logic and is called during each execution. This function is designed to be lightweight and reusable considering Instructions are designed to be executed many times.
