Each Instruction has a fee associated with it that the user pays each time their Instruction is successfully executed. The fee is calculated off-chain based on the particular Instruction the user has constructed, then it's presented to the user for approval. If the user is willing to pay this per-execution-fee, they sign the Instruction and it's sent off to be executed, otherwise Otim will not execute the Instruction. 

This fee can be paid in the blockchain's native token or any ERC20 token that Otim accepts.
