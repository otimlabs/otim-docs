Actions and Instructions work together as the building blocks of Otim's execution engine. Actions are smart contracts that define what can be executed, while Instructions specify how and when these Actions should be executed. Think of Actions as the "what" and Instructions as the "when" and "how" of each automated operation.

To give a simple example, you might create an Instruction to transfer 0.1 ETH to your friend Alice every week. Let's deconstruct this sentence:

* "transfer" here refers to executing the `Transfer` Action contract

* "0.1 ETH" and "to Alice" refer to specific `Transfer` Action arguments

* "every week" refers to specific Instruction scheduling parameters
