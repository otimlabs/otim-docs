Otim is a digital asset operating system that unlocks smart on-chain actions for any Ethereum address without migrating funds or altering your existing security posture.

Simply delegate to Otim, select an Action, construct an Instruction with execution conditions, and activate!

# Why Otim?

Otim lets your EOA do more, without sacrificing what makes it great. It’s as if your account got an upgrade — like Tony Stark putting on his Iron Man suit. You keep full custody, control, and security, but gain the ability to automate actions and execute complex strategies effortlessly.

1. **Automate on-chain operations**: Construct Instructions and set conditions for when Actions — like payments, swaps, or transfers — should happen. Otim automatically executes your Actions when the moment is right.

2. **Zero trust in external actors**: Unlike other protocols, Otim ensures that trust remains on-chain, without computational validation falling on external validators or off-chain agents. Everything happens directly through the protocol itself.

3. **Retain full custody and control**: Your EOA remains secure and in your hands. Otim adds superpowers, but you’re always in control of what happens and when. There's no need to learn or manage new types of accounts.
